# What is JSON:API?

[JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) is a specification for building web APIs that use JSON as the data interchange format.
It provides a set of guidelines and conventions for structuring your API responses, making it easier for clients to
consume your API and reducing ambiguity in API design. JSON:API is designed to promote consistency and efficiency
when working with RESTful APIs.

## Key Features of JSON:API

JSON:API offers several key features that make it a popular choice for building APIs:

1. **Consistent Structure:** JSON:API enforces a consistent structure for API responses.
All responses follow a standardized format, which includes data, metadata, and links.
This uniformity simplifies client-side code and reduces the need for custom parsing.

2. **Resource-Oriented:**
JSON:API focuses on resources as the primary building blocks of your API.
Resources represent objects or entities in your application, such as users, articles, or products.
Each resource has a unique URL, making it easy for clients to access and manipulate them.

3. **Relationships:**
JSON:API provides a mechanism for defining and navigating relationships between resources.
This allows clients to request related data with a single API call, reducing the number of requests needed to retrieve
complex information.

4. **Pagination:**
The specification includes support for pagination, allowing you to efficiently handle large datasets.
Clients can request a specific page of results, making it easier to work with extensive collections of resources.

5. **Inclusion:**
Clients can request related resources to be included in the response, reducing the need for multiple API calls to
retrieve associated data. This feature improves API efficiency and reduces client-side complexity.

6. **Sorting and Filtering:**
JSON:API supports sorting and filtering of resources, enabling clients to retrieve data in a specific order or based
on certain criteria. This is particularly useful for searching and sorting large datasets.

7. **Error Handling:**
The specification defines a standardized format for reporting errors in API responses.
This consistency helps clients handle errors gracefully and provides clear error messages.

## Steps to Implement JSON:API

Common steps for implementing JSON:API in a Laravel and Doctrine ORM project include:

1. **Model Definitions:**
Define your application's data models\entities using Doctrine ORM for object-relational mapping.

2. **Resource Definitions:**
Create resource definitions that map your models to JSON:API resources.
These definitions specify how to serialize your models into JSON:API-compliant data.

3. **Controller Actions:**
Implement controller actions to handle incoming API requests, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
These actions should adhere to JSON:API conventions for routing and response formatting.

4. **Validation and Error Handling:**
Implement validation rules for incoming data and handle errors using JSON:API error responses.

5. **Relationships:**
Define and manage relationships between resources according to JSON:API specifications.

6. **Pagination, Inclusion, Sorting, and Filtering:**
Implement features like pagination, inclusion, sorting, and filtering to provide clients with flexibility in data retrieval.

7. **Testing:**
Write unit and integration tests to ensure your API adheres to the JSON:API specification and functions as expected.
