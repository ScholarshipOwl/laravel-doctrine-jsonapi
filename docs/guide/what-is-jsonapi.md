# What is JSON:API?
[JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) is a specification for building RESTful APIs in JSON, providing a set of conventions for structuring API responses to ensure consistency and efficiency. It focuses on resources as the primary building blocks of the API, each with a unique URL for easy access and manipulation.

This standardization simplifies client-side code, reduces the need for custom parsing, and enhances the efficiency of data retrieval.

## Key Features of JSON:API

JSON:API provides a set of conventions for structuring API responses to ensure consistency and efficiency.

1. **Standardized Response Structure**

    JSON:API defines a standardized structure for API responses and requests, making it easier for clients to parse and process data.
    This consistency reduces the need for custom parsing and simplifies client-side code.

2. **Focus on Resources**

    JSON:API treats resources as the primary components of your API.
    Each resource has a unique URL for easy access and manipulation.

3. **Relationships**

    JSON:API provides a mechanism for defining and navigating relationships between resources.
    This allows clients to request related data with a single API call, reducing the number of requests needed to retrieve complex information.

4. **Inclusion**

    JSON:API supports inclusion of related resources in responses, enabling clients to retrieve related data with a single API call.
    This reduces the number of requests needed to retrieve complex information.

5. **Sorting and Filtering**

    JSON:API supports sorting and filtering of resources, enabling clients to retrieve data in a specific order or based
    on certain criteria. This is particularly useful for searching and sorting large datasets.

6. **Pagination**

    JSON:API supports pagination of resources, enabling clients to retrieve data in chunks rather than all at once.
    This is particularly useful for large datasets.

7. **Error Handling**

    JSON:API defines a standardized format for error responses, making it easier for clients to handle errors.
    This consistency reduces the need for custom error handling and simplifies client-side code.
